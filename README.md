# Operating-Systems---Command-Shell
Command shell using C language 

Following functions:

1. Tree: this new command will create a directory and call it Dir0. Then it will change the working
directory to Dir0, and create three empty text files namely, t1.txt, t2.txt, t3.txt, and one empty
directory, called Dir1, inside it.

2. List: this new command will clear the terminal screen and print a detailed list of all content of
the current directory (like ls -l) to the terminal and t1.txt. Finally, it will change the name of text
file to tree.txt.

3. Path: this new command will print the path of the current directory to the terminal and t2.txt,
and change the name of text file to path.txt. Concatenate the content of tree.txt and path.txt
into t3.txt and change the last to log.txt. Finally, delete tree.txt and path.txt.

4. Exit: this new command will print a list the last 4 commands to the terminal, a detailed list of all
content of the current directory (like ls -l). Finally, it will wait for the user to hit the “return” key
to terminate the shell and return the control to the original shell program on your machine
